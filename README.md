This bundle is a maintained fork of the SnowcapCore Bundle: https://github.com/snowcap/SnowcapCoreBundle

It requires Symfony 3.3+/4.0+/5.0+ and PHP >= 7.1.3.

It aims to help with some repetitive tasks, including (but not limited to):

* Dealing with file and image uploads
* RSS feed generation
* SEO-related tasks (sitemaps, etc)
* Building searchable & filterable data lists
